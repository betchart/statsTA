* QCD shape systematic: perhaps divide the sideband into two regions (chwalek) (in progress)

* produce results plots with fitted symmetric and antisymmetric components (in progress: still need axis labels)

* fit XT (XL) asymmetry independently from inclusive ttbar diff. xs.
* fnal batch

* calibrate to MC@NLO / MADGRAPH / BSM
