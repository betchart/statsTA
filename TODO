* QCD shape systematic: perhaps divide the sideband into two regions (chwalek) (in progress)

* lumi_dep

* ensemble tests for subselections

* produce results plots with fitted symmetric and antisymmetric components (in progress: still need axis labels)
-- axis labels
-- individual antisymmetric components

* fit XT (XL) asymmetry independently from inclusive ttbar diff. xs.
* fnal batch

* calibrate to MC@NLO / MADGRAPH / BSM
