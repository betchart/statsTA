batch the stats
check template uncertainty on results: 100 poisson drawings, smallest ellipse enclosing 68
do Q^2 variations via Q = 0.5x or 2x top mass in pdf reweightings
increase delta_xs for DY and ST to 10%
including alpha strong reweighting


include raw asymmetry in results
include projections of template distributions
include additional ensembles


* visualize

* less hacky ensemble testing
